## Project Overview

Welcome to our cub3d project! As a team, we'll be diving into the exciting world of raycasting and basic 3D graphics programming. Our main goal is to create a simple 3D maze game from scratch using raycasting techniques.

## Summary

This project is inspired by the world-famous [Wolfenstein 3D game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D), which was the first FPS ever. It is a remarkable technique to explore, and a great opportunity to create a game with a good design and a nice user interface.

![cool-guys-1992-small](https://github.com/zelhajou/42-cub3D/assets/39954629/e53038ee-d9ed-43fa-8f58-44ee63a5ede3)

Developed by [id Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Software) and published by [Apogee Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apogee_Software), Wolfenstein 3D was released in 1992. It was a revolutionary game that popularized the FPS genre and helped establish the PC as a gaming platform.

## I. Project Setup

### Step 1: Setup

Create the project directory structure and necessary files.

```bash
mkdir -p cub3d/src/main cub3d/src/parsing cub3d/src/rendering cub3d/src/utils
mkdir -p cub3d/includes cub3d/assets/textures cub3d/assets/maps
```

### Step 2: Create Files

Create the main source files and header file for the project.

```bash
touch cub3d/src/main/main.c
touch cub3d/src/parsing/parse.c
touch cub3d/src/rendering/render.c
touch cub3d/src/utils/utils.c
touch cub3d/includes/cub3d.h
touch cub3d/assets/textures/.gitkeep
touch cub3d/assets/maps/.gitkeep
touch cub3d/Makefile
```

## II. Parsing Configuration File

The first step in our project is to read and parse the configuration file (.cub) that defines our game settings. The configuration file contains information about the map layout, textures, colors, resolution, and other parameters needed to set up the game environment.

Here's an example of a simple configuration file:

```cub
NO ./assets/textures/north.png
SO ./assets/textures/south.png
WE ./assets/textures/west.png
EA ./assets/textures/east.png

F 220,100,0
C 0,0,100

 1111111        111111111
110000011      10000000001
100000001     1000000000001
 1000001     100000000000001
  11011      1000000000000001
   101        1000000100000001
   101         100001 100000001
   101111111111100000100000001
   10000000000000000000000001
   1011111111111000000000001
   101         100000000001
   101        100000000001
  11011      100000000001
 1000001     1000000N0001
100000001     10000000001
110000011      1000000001
 1111111        111111111
```

In this example, the configuration file specifies the following settings:

- **Textures**:
    - North wall texture: `./assets/textures/north.png`
    - South wall texture: `./assets/textures/south.png`
    - West wall texture: `./assets/textures/west.png`
    - East wall texture: `./assets/textures/east.png`
- **Floor Color**: RGB value (220,100,0)
- **Ceiling Color**: RGB value (0,0,100)
- **Map Layout**:
    - `1`: Wall
    - `0`: Empty space
    - `N`, `S`, `W`, `E`: Player starting position and direction

Our task is to read and parse this configuration file to extract these settings and use them to set up the game environment.

To achieve this, we'll need to implement functions to:

- Open and read the configuration file.
- Parse the data to extract relevant settings.
- Validate the data to ensure it's in the correct format.
- Store the settings in appropriate data structures for later use.

### Map requirements

1. **Map Elements**: The map must contain only the following elements:
    - 0: Empty space
    - 1: Wall
2. **Map Shape**: The map must be surrounded by walls (1) on all sides. The map's shape can be a rectangle, but it can also have holes inside it.
3. **Valid Characters**: Only the map elements mentioned above and spaces are valid characters in the map. Any other character is considered invalid.
4. Starting Position: The map must have a starting position for the player. This starting position must be represented by one of the following characters:
    - N: North
    - S: South
    - W: West
    - E: East

### Prsing and Storing the Configuration File

To parse the configuration file, we'll need to:

1. **Read the File**: Open and read the configuration file line by line.
2. **Parse the Data**: Extract relevant settings from each line of the file.
3. **Store the Data**: Store the settings in appropriate data structures for later use.

Here's a basic outline of the steps involved in parsing the configuration file:

1. **Open File**: Open the configuration file for reading using the `open` system call.
2. **Read Lines**: Read each line of the file using the `get_next_line` function.
3. **Parse Data**: Parse the data from each line to extract relevant settings (e.g., textures, colors, map layout).

To store the configuration settings, we'll define a `t_config` structure to hold the extracted data:

```c
typedef struct s_config
{
    char    *no_texture;
    char    *we_texture;
    char    *so_texture;
    char    *ea_texture;
    int     floor_color;
    int     ceiling_color;
    char    **map;
    char    **map_copy;
    size_t  map_width;
    size_t  map_height;
    int     map_started;
}    t_config;
```

The `t_config` structure contains fields to store the configuration settings extracted from the configuration file. We'll use this structure to store the textures, colors, and map layout.

```bash
└── src
    ├── parsing
    │   ├── color
    │   │   ├── color_parsing.c
    │   │   └── color_validation.c
    │   ├── config
    │   │   ├── config_file_parsing.c
    │   │   └── config_validation.c
    │   ├── map
    │   │   ├── map_parsing.c
    │   │   └── map_validation.c
    │   └── texture
    │       ├── texture_parsing.c
    │       └── texture_validation.c
```

The `color`, `config`, `map`, and `texture` directories contain functions for parsing and validating the color, configuration, map, and texture settings, respectively. Each directory contains two files: one for parsing the data and one for validating it.

By parsing and storing the configuration file, we'll be able to extract the game settings needed to set up the game environment.

## III. Initialize Graphics

The next step in our project is to initialize the graphics rendering engine using the `minilibx` library. The Minilibx library is a simple graphics library that provides functions for creating windows, drawing pixels, and handling user input.

To set up the graphics rendering engine, we'll need to:

- Initialize the Minilibx library.
- Create a window for rendering the game.
- Set up a buffer for rendering pixels to the window.
- Handle user input for player controls.

Here's a basic outline of the steps involved in setting up the graphics rendering engine:

1. **Initialize Minilibx**: Start by initializing the Minilibx library to set up the graphics environment.
2. **Create Window**: Create a window for rendering the game using the `mlx_new_window` function.
3. **Setup Buffer**: Set up a buffer for rendering pixels to the window using the `mlx_new_image` function.
4. **Handle User Input**: Implement functions to handle user input for player controls (e.g., movement, rotation).

By setting up the graphics rendering engine, we'll be able to display the game world and interact with it using player controls.
